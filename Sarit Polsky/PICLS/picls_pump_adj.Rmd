We will plan to analyze the number of pump adjustments made per gestational week and the average basal rates, carb ratios, and correction factors for each meal period (breakfast, lunch, evening, overnight) for each time period in pregnancy (4-8 weeks gestation, etc.).

these are the pump settings we're looking at: total daily dose, total daily bolus, total daily basal, and percent basal/bolus
