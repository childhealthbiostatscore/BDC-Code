#Statistical Methods
There were a total of 75 participants and 16 controls in the data with differing numbers of visits during baseline, year 1, year 2, year 3, and year 4. Only those who were followed at least 3 years were included in this analysis.  Baseline visit was indicated by clinician. Visits were categorized into 12 visit windows Â±1.5 months around target visit times (three month intervals after baseline). Up to 3 years of data were analyzed. If there was more than one visit in a window, the visit nearest to the target was selected. The last visit of each year was utilized for descriptive statistics and analyses.

If a participant was less than 12 years of age during year 1 and transitioned to greater than or equal to 12 years of age during that year, the participant was considered less than 12 years old during the entirety of year 1. If a participant was less than 12 years old during year 2 and transitioned to greater than or equal to 12 years old during that year, the participant was considered less than 12 years old during the entirety of year 2. The same was done for year 3 age categories.  The checks per day variable was only reported for patients who were never on CGM during a given year.
Descriptive statistics were obtained for A1c and checks per day.  The summary was stratified by treatment group and age group (<12 years old, ???12 years old).  
Linear mixed effects models were used to test whether there was a significant difference in the trend of A1c from baseline to year 3 by treatment group, after adjusting for age category, diabetes duration, and technology type (CGM only, Pump only, neither, or both). Least squares were used to test for whether there was a significant difference in A1c between treatment groups at baseline, year 1, year 2, and year 3.  As a sensitivity analysis, the model was also fit separately for each age group.  The linear mixed effects models were repeated for the outcome of checks per day, to test if there was a difference between LP and control patients in terms of checks per day during each year of the program. 

Descriptive statistics for pump usage and CGM use by time period, age category, and treatment group were obtained. If a participant ever used a pump during a time period, pump usage was considered to be 'Yes.' If a participant never used a pump during a visit for a time period, pump usage was considered to be 'No.' The same logic was used for CGM use. A frequency and percent of pump usage and CGM usage for participants during baseline, year1, year 2, and year 3 were obtained by age cohort.  Using all patients that had both baseline and year 3 pump/CGM data, a paired t-test reported whether there was significant change in usage from baseline to year 3.
