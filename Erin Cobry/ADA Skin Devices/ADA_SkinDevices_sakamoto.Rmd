# Outstanding Data Remarks/ Questions

- Some subjects race had multiple checked. Currently classifying in own category as multirace for demographic description
  - Distribution of race overwhelmingly white with only a few nonwhite (N = 11 nonwhite across 4 categories, 86 White) maybe Dichotomize W/NW?

# Background

Skin related questions (selected items) â€“ Skin and Diabetes Devices Survey (after Demographics)
a.	Skin reactions due to the use of glucose sensor (please describe location and skin reaction): Question #1 (skin reaction due to the use of CGM (yes/no)), Question #2 (location of skin reaction), Question #3 (description of skin reaction)
b.	Skin reaction due to the use of insulin pump (please describe location and skin reaction):  Question #4 (skin reaction due to the use of insulin pump (yes/no)), Question #5 (location of skin reaction), Question #6 (description of skin reaction)

Analysis Ideas
1.	Categorize based on race/ethnicity and gender (Race/ethnicity and gender can both be found on Demographics section of the survey)
a.	Analyze if there was a difference in skin reactions incidence with diabetes devices (combine those with CGM only, pump only, and CGM and pump reactions) _and the race/ethnicity (include how many of each category). 
b.	Analyze if there was a difference in skin reactions incidence with diabetes devices (combine those with CGM only, pump only, and CGM and pump reactions) _and the gender (include how many of each category).
