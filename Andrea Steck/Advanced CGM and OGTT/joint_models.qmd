## Model selection (based on mean glucose)

### Cox model

For the survival submodel, AIC was compared between a Cox proportional hazards model and Weibull, exponential, gaussian, logistic,lognormal and log logistic models. The Cox PH model had the lowest AIC and visual inspection of model residuals suggested good model fit. AIC and concordance was also better for the Cox model with age as the time variable compared to the Cox model with time from first CGM as the time variable.

```{r}
# Cox model
cox_fit_age <- coxph(
  Surv(AgeEndpoint, event) ~ sex +
    Race_Ethn2 +
    screen_FDR_GP +
    maxAB_group,
  x = T,
  model = T,
  data = cgm_surv
)
cox_fit_time <- coxph(
  Surv(EndTime, event) ~ sex +
    Race_Ethn2 +
    screen_FDR_GP +
    maxAB_group,
  x = T,
  model = T,
  data = cgm_surv
)
AIC(cox_fit_age, cox_fit_time)
```

#### Results

```{r}

```

#### Diagnostics

##### Age as time variable

```{r}
ggcoxdiagnostics(cox_fit_age, type = "martingale", linear.predictions = F)
ggcoxdiagnostics(cox_fit_age, type = "deviance", linear.predictions = F)

ggcoxdiagnostics(cox_fit_age, type = "schoenfeld", linear.predictions = F)
ggcoxdiagnostics(cox_fit_age, type = "partial", linear.predictions = F)
```

##### Years from first CGM as time variable

```{r}
ggcoxdiagnostics(cox_fit_time, type = "martingale", linear.predictions = F)

### Linear model results

Models with random slope and random intercept for participant were better than those with just a random intercept by AIC. The linear model using years from first CGM as the time variable was better than the model using age as the time variable by AIC.

```{r}
lme_fit_mean_rs_age <- lme(
  mean_glucose_scaled ~ Age,
  random = ~ Age | ID,
  data = cgm_lmm
)
lme_fit_mean_rs_time <- lme(
  mean_glucose_scaled ~ TimeFromFirstCGM,
  random = ~ TimeFromFirstCGM | ID,
  data = cgm_lmm
)
plot_df = lme_fit_mean_rs_age$data
plot_df$pred = predict(lme_fit_mean_rs_age)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = Age, color = ID)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_glucose_scaled), alpha = 0.2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred))
plot_df = lme_fit_mean_rs_time$data
plot_df$pred = predict(lme_fit_mean_rs_time)

```

```{r}

```

Without TrialNet data, the joint model for mean glucose using time from first CGM does not converge. After z-scaling mean glucose, one chain still appears to be different from the others and raises some concerns about the model despite eventually returning to the same sample space as the other chains. Also, the $\hat{R}$ estimates are all way too high (mc-stan.org recommends "running at least four chains by default and only using the sample if R-hat is less than 1.05").

With TrialNet data included, the marginal DIC favors the joint model with time from first CGM as the time variable, but the conditional DIC favors the model with age as time. Because there is some debate about which DIC to use in joint model selection, but generally speaking marginal would be more generalizable for a prediction question  whereas conditional is more relevant to the sample included in the model. 

```{r}
newdat = full_join(cgm_lmm, cgm_surv)
roc_age = tvROC(
  joint_fit_mean_age,
  newdata = newdat,
  Tstart = quantile(cgm_surv$AgeEndpoint, 0.75),
  Dt = 1
)
tvAUC(roc_age)
roc_time = tvROC(
  joint_fit_mean_time,
  newdata = newdat,
  Tstart = quantile(cgm_surv$EndTime, 0.75),
  Dt = 1
)
tvAUC(roc_time)
```

Because there was no winner in terms of DIC and the tvROCAUC favors the age as time model when using 75% of the data, we have chosen to proceed with the age as time model for now. However, clinical intent/relevance should really be the tiebreaker between the two time variables (i.e., what are we hoping to achieve with these models?).
