# Moderated T Tests

## CARV

### All

Moderated t tests were performed to test for differences in proteins between those who experienced CARV and those who did not. The results immediately below were not stratified by sex or storage time.

```{r results='asis'}
# limma stratified by storage time
sample.info$storage_time = sample.info$VisitAge - sample.info$AGE00
sample.info$storage_time = cut(sample.info$storage_time,2,labels = c("< 14",">= 14"))
low = sample.info[sample.info$storage_time=="< 14",]
high = sample.info[sample.info$storage_time==">= 14",]
# Make design matrix
carv <- model.matrix(~CARV,sample.info[!is.na(sample.info$storage_time),])
# Unadjusted models
y <- t(intensities[,2:ncol(intensities)])
fit <- lmFit(y,carv)
fit <- eBayes(fit)
# Results
res = topTable(fit,coef = 2,number=nrow(y),sort.by = "p")
res$Name = compound_info$Description[as.numeric(sub("V","",rownames(res)))]
res$Function = compound_info$mol_function[as.numeric(sub("V","",rownames(res)))]
kable(res,row.names = F)
write.csv(res,"/Volumes/Shared/Shared Projects/Laura/BDC/Projects/Janet Snell-Bergeon/CACTI DCCT EDIC omics R01/Proteomics/Reports/glycated_proteomics_by_CARV.csv")
```

#### Adjusted for sex, age, diabetes duration, treatment group

```{r results='asis'}

```

There were `r sum(res$P.Value < 0.05,na.rm=T)` nominally significant proteins.
